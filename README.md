# Forecast_Dashboard
Forecast Dashboard is a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Using the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api), the application retrieves weather data for cities and displays both the daily forecast and 5-day forecast.
